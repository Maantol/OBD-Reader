# OBD-Reader

OBD-Reader is my personal interest project as a long side with other project in order to gain more experience with software development projects and
trying to incrementally add more functions to this software.

Currently my setup is ELM327 adapter, which is currently unstable (cheap clone one) and needs to be updated in order to proceed with project.

OBD-Reader uses python-OBD library. Visit: https://python-obd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Install required modules

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python obd_reader.py
```
